range() creates a list i.e., range returns a Python list object, for example, range (1,500,1) will create a python list of 499 integers in memory. Remember, range() generates all numbers at once.
xrange() functions returns an xrange object that evaluates lazily. That means xrange only stores the range arguments and generates the numbers on demand. It doesn’t generate all numbers at once like range(). Furthermore, this object only supports indexing, iteration, and the len() function.
On the other hand xrange() generates the numbers on demand. That means it produces number one by one as for loop moves to the next number. In every iteration of for loop, it generates the next number and assigns it to the iterator variable of for loop.
